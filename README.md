# Baseline TF-IDF Analysis (WP3)

## Introduction

The Baseline TF-IDF Analysis (WP3) provides baseline scoring using conventional machine learning classifiers and methods.

## Installation

`pip install -r requirements.txt` 

## Recommended Requirements

- CPUs: 10 (based on n_jobs setting in classification.py)
- RAM: 256gb

## Configuration

The configuration file, `config.py`, can be used in order to set:

- `MATERIALS_PATH`:  The path for inputs (e.g., input data, intermediary data sets).
- `RESULTS_PATH`:  The path for output (e.g., tables, images).
- `RANDOM_STATE`: This setting will be used as an argument to all `random_state` parameters in the pipeline.  This setting can be hard-coded in order to ensure reproducibility.  

The materials directory contains the source data for the pipeline.  Copy the contents of the [`materials`](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1a-uW8QXx_auK52q9y1cJm1uMr3DYLlBo) directory to the root of the repository.

## Usage

The main entry point for the pipeline is the file named `main.py`.  `Main.py` will export the notebooks to `.py` files and run each step of the pipeline. The pipeline may take several days to run.

Run the pipeline:

```bash
python main.py
```
